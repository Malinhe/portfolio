        <p>
           Hi, I am a Front-end developer based in Bremerhaven, Germany. 
           I started my IT journey at a 4-week workshop for women. During this workshop, 
           I was able to explore different areas of IT. I enjoyed programming the most 
           and found it to be the best fit for my skills.

            <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
                Standing still is not for me, I constantly need fresh input. That's why I love my job as a programmer, 
                because constant further training is required here due to new technologies.

                Analytical thinking and solution-oriented action are what makes me special.
                My guiding principle is: There is a solution for every problem.
