           Hi, I am a Front-end developer based in Bremerhaven, Germany. 
           I take pleasure in solving problems and bringing complex ideas to life. 
           My ambition is to continue my career as a developer and find a position as a junior web developer.

                I started my IT journey at a 4-week workshop for women. During this workshop, 
                I was able to explore different areas of IT. I enjoyed programming the most 
                and found it to be the best fit for my skills.

                Standing still is not for me, I constantly need fresh input. That's why I love my job as a programmer, 
                because constant further training is required here due to new technologies.
                Analytical thinking and solution-oriented action are what makes me special.
                My guiding principle is: There is a solution for every problem.
